// "Coding Challenge #2: Computer Store"

// The function will add the specified amount of restaurant names passed in (numOfRestaurants) from the restaurants array to another array called randomRestaurantList. It is ok if a restaurant appears in your list more than once.

// "Coding Challenge #4: Leap Year"

// Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial (years divisible by 100) years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is.
// function that returns true if the year input is a leap year, and false if the year input is a common year. For example, when isLeapYear(2000) is called, it should return the value true. 
function isLeapYear(year) {
    // the year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4 AND NOT divisible by 100
    if(year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) {
        return true;
    // the year is a leap year if it's divisible by 100 AND divisible by 400
    } else if(year % 100 === 0 && year % 400 === 0) {
        return true;
    // if both statements above are false, the year is a common year
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}

// display true if the year is a leap year and false if the year is a common year
console.log(isLeapYear(2024));

// Make sure to check that each of your challenge functions are working as expected by using console.log() statements and checking the output against what you would expect.
